# Gov School Dirty Math
A repository for all the programs, simulations, etc. I make associated with the dirt under the fingernails mathematics course at Virginia Summer Residential Governor's School
- The course focuses on the evolution of systems over time
- This repository is divided up into folders for each day of the course
    - Some of the simulations are from problems across multiple days that continue along the same idea
